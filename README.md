# DAF - Decentralized Autonomous Federation

[PortuguÃªs](./README.PT.md) | English | 

 -The alliance basis between Drayker DAOs and DACs - Organization and Governance Labs

The initial DAO is funded by grants and side projects, all support requests must be made in situations where there are no other alternatives, resource efficiency is important here, and major projects are the priority.

Anyone, team, project, or initiative can create their own DAO and link it to the smart federation contract, over time DAOs accumulate federative points and voting power over federation resources and federation decisions.
